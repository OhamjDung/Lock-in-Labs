I would do some journaling, and then excercise, and then some vocal practice to improve my communication skills. Then i would love to dedicate some time to volleyball, to coding, and to family and friends.

 coding is more of a solitary thing for me. I love creating and being productive, regardless of people are doing it or not. If things were to fail in my code, i would just adapt. I would find the issue, solve the issue if possible, if the problem lies in the foundation then ill change the foundation.

 I think connections for me is more functional but its also emotional. Having friends is fun, i get to study with them and stuff and it makes me less lonely, but theyre also good people to ask feedback and play volleyball with. 

  i would listen first, then i would offer some solutions. Ill also ask if they want me to listen or give advice. When in a team effort i try to help but not be too demanding         

data analysis, do data visualization. 

And vocal practice is for practicing my communication skills

i play alot of volleyball but i need to hit the gym more to do Plyometrics to jump higher and also muscle building. 

I just try to stay busy. When i get overwhelmed i just start do something, anything, because i dont want to sit there and do nothing while everything is happeneing.

yea i have a different friend group for different purposes. Like i go to eat with each friend group from time to time but like each friend group has its own main function based on a activity

current gym routine huh, i just go in there and do shoulder machines, do leg machines, arm machines, and back machines. Each of them i save the weight, and progressively overload and train to failure. And I just want a more asthetic body and have better cardio

i have a group of friends i play vollyball with yes, its very fun

like what i actually spend my time towards, what i WANT to spend my time towards, seeing actual progress in myself, tracking my goals and how long it takes

with journaling i want to be able to not just plan out my day but i want to be more organized and have a better understanding of myself like i said before

yea i want to get a job, a job in data visualizations
